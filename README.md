Shufen Yin’s Data Science Portfolio

This repository showcases my Data Science skills across data analysis, data engineering, machine learning, and visualization through real-world projects.
It demonstrates workflows from data preprocessing and feature engineering to modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

Portfolio & Projects Overview

The portfolio is organized into the following main categories, each containing project-level notebooks, reports, and datasets:

01_Basic_Data_Analysis – Core Analysis Projects

Sales_Analysis – monthly trends and top-product insights

Customer_Segmentation – K-Means clustering for customer targeting

SQL Projects – database analysis and reporting

02_Visualization – BI & Dashboard Projects

Sales Dashboard, Healthcare Dashboard, General BI Dashboard

Tools: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn

03_Advanced_Analysis – Machine Learning & Advanced Analytics

Anomaly Detection – outlier detection techniques

PCA_Neural_Network – dimensionality reduction + neural network modeling

Stock_Signal_Prediction – time series prediction, model evaluation

04_Financial_Analysis – Financial Modeling

Credit Card Fraud Detection – classification and evaluation

05_Healthcare_Projects – Healthcare Analytics

Medical Cost Prediction – regression models predicting costs

Data Engineering Projects
